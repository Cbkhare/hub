description: This action will stream a compressed filesystem archive into archive2disk where it will mount a block device and uncompress this archive to a destination path on it's filesystem. Usually the `DEST_PATH` should be `/` as we normally will be writing a root filesystem, however it can be used to stream application data to a different area on disk (such as preloading container images, or web server assets).
