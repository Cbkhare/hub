    The `cexec` action performs _execution_ either within a [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) environment or within the base filesystem. The primary use-case is being able to provision files/an Operating System to disk and then being able to execute something that perhaps resides within that filesystem.

    ```
    actions:
        - name: "Install Grub"
          image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/cexec:v1.0.0
          timeout: 90
          environment:
              BLOCK_DEVICE: /dev/sda3
              FS_TYPE: ext4
              CHROOT: y
              CMD_LINE: "grub-install --root-directory=/boot /dev/sda"
    ```

    In order to execute multiple commands (seperated by a semi-colon) we will need to leverage a shell. We do this by passing `sh -c` as a `DEFAULT_INTERPRETER`. This interpreter will then parse your commands.

    ```
    actions:
        - name: "Update packages"
          image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/cexec:v1.0.0
          timeout: 90
          environment:
              BLOCK_DEVICE: /dev/sda3
              FS_TYPE: ext4
              CHROOT: y
              DEFAULT_INTERPRETER: "/bin/sh -c"
              CMD_LINE: "apt-get -y update; apt-get -y upgrade"
    ```
