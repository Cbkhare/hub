    Slurp will read directly from a block device, it can compress this stream and will use the HTTP protocol to transmit the raw data to a listening server. The remote server needs to be able to handle `multipart` data (due to the size) and reform this to a disk image locally.

    The below example will stream a raw ubuntu installed on `/dev/sda` and uplopad it to a remote server.

    ```
    actions:
      - name: "slurp_ubuntu"
        image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/slurp:v1.0.0
        timeout: 90
        environment:
          DEST_URL: http://192.168.1.2:3000/image
          SOURCE_DISK: /dev/sda
          IMG_NAME: ubuntu_wordpress
          COMPRESSED: false
    ```

    **Note** the `DEST_URL`, the slurp action has a server that can be used with this action. It can be started with `go run server/main.go -port 3000`, which will create a web server that has a handler on the url `/image` to manage images that are uploaded too it.
